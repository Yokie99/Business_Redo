Desktop Home Page - The "View All Upcoming Events" link looks out of place since it is the only blue color on the screen. THere is also quite a bit of empty space between the lorem ipsum and the link. Also maybe the logo on the top left could link back to home page.

Mobile Home Page - The event page text is hard to see on mobile, so maybe you can enlarge the image somehow. For the 3 portal buttons, if you want to keep the border radius, I think you should add padding or margin so that it doesn't touch the side of the screen. The footer text in mobile is overlapping.

Desktop About Page - The border for the accordion is a bit thicker in some places // fixed (1/6/24)

Mobile About Page - All the header texts on mobile are kinda small and hard to read. For the gym photos on mobile I think you adding margin bottom so that they aren't touching would look better.

Desktop and Mobile Our calsses Page - this page is good!

Desktop competition page - the text on the image is kind of hard to see for the first image. For the meets section, I think you could add some color to the background because it looks like a lot of text on a page.

Mobile competition page - The text for mobile is hugging the sides a little too much so you can try adding margin.

Desktop and Mobile Reservation page - the blue text stands out, but that is just a nitpick.
